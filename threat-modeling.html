        <p> Now, the most important thing to take back your privacy is threat modeling. A threat model says who you hide from, how important it is<br>
          to hide said info, your conveience level, etc. This great guide from <a href="https://www.cupwire.com/threat-modeling/" target="_blank">
          Cupwire</a> shows how to threat model. I will do my best to paraphrase.<br> The difference between Privacy and being Anonymous is that
          being Anonymous means you don't want people to know you use Signal. <br>Privacy is they know you use it, but not knowing how. </p>

         <p> If you want to hide from your friends/family, simply lock your devices. Hiding from compaines can be stuff like changing to Firefox<br>
           from Chrome, Startpage from Google, Linux from Windows. Hiding from hackers and stuff requires commitment like lying whenever legally possible, hardening<br> 
           your phone and hardening your OS. The extreme is true anonymity. The <a href="https://www.cupwire.com/threat-modeling/" target="_blank">
          Cupwire</a> article goes more in depth.
