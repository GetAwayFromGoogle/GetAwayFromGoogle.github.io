<img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/12/Hero-Rebound--122021.png" alt="DuckDuckGo in 2021: Building the Privacy Super App"><p>We believe online privacy should be simple and accessible to everyone. That&#x2019;s why we spent 2021 strengthening our all-in-one privacy solution and helping people take back their privacy with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app">one easy download</a>. </p><p>From improvements to search, tracker blocking, and our mobile app, to new features like <a href="https://www.spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Email Protection</a> and <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-app-tracking-protection/" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Tracking Protection</a>, we&apos;re building a simple privacy layer for how people use the Internet today, without any tradeoffs. It&#x2019;s privacy, simplified.</p><p>As our product becomes even easier to use and more comprehensive, we&#x2019;ve seen a tremendous response from users. We&#x2019;re now the most downloaded browsing app on Android in our major markets (and #2 on iOS behind Chrome), we&#x2019;re averaging more than 100 million searches a day, and our most recent survey showed 27 million Americans (9%) use DuckDuckGo.</p><p>Worldwide we&#x2019;ve had over 150 million downloads of our all-in-one privacy apps and extensions since we moved beyond just private search in 2018. Check out a recap of some of the progress we made in 2021, and a first look at our desktop app, now in closed beta.</p><p><strong>Email Protection: Ducking Email Trackers in Your Inbox</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/12/A--Proof-of-Trackers.v1-opt.gif" class="kg-image" alt="DuckDuckGo in 2021: Building the Privacy Super App" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"></figure><p>We announced the beta release of <a href="https://www.spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/">Email Protection</a>, our free email forwarding service that removes trackers in your email and protects the privacy of your personal email address without asking you to change email providers. Join the waitlist through the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app">DuckDuckGo mobile app</a> today!</p><p></p><p><strong>App Tracking Protection: Extending Privacy to Your Android Apps</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/12/B--Activity-Report.v1-opt.gif" class="kg-image" alt="DuckDuckGo in 2021: Building the Privacy Super App" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"></figure><p>Last month we released <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-app-tracking-protection/">App Tracking Protection</a> into beta, a new feature in our Android app that blocks third-party trackers like Google and Facebook lurking in other apps. Users trying out the new feature are <a href="https://twitter.com/pauljacobson/status/1472439926818058241">already</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/theunfocused/status/1470287250348855298">surprised</a> by how much tracking normally happens on their devices. Join the waitlist through the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">DuckDuckGo Android app</a> to give it a try!</p><p></p><p><strong>Private Search: Better Results, Updated Design, Same Privacy. </strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/12/Slide-C--122021.png" class="kg-image" alt="DuckDuckGo in 2021: Building the Privacy Super App" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Slide-C--122021.png 600w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/Slide-C--122021.png 1000w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/12/Slide-C--122021.png 1600w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/12/Slide-C--122021.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>This year we made a lot of improvements to our <a href="https://start.duckduckgo.com/">search results</a>. If you tried our search engine a few years ago, but could only go part-time then, you should really give us another shot in 2022. We revamped our search results page to give it a more simple and modern design, and continued to refine and improve our local, maps, and directions results. </p><p>Some other improvements we made include a new <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=privacy+in+spanish&amp;t=osx&amp;ia=web">translations instant answer</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=define+privacy&amp;t=osx&amp;ia=definition">revamped definitions</a> and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=weather&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=weather">weather</a> answers, custom date range filtering, more filters on images, and improvements to advanced search. You can expect even more search improvements in the coming year.</p><p></p><p><strong>Tracker Blocking: Extending Blocking to Embedded Facebook Content</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/12/Slide-D--122021.png" class="kg-image" alt="DuckDuckGo in 2021: Building the Privacy Super App" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Slide-D--122021.png 600w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/Slide-D--122021.png 1000w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/12/Slide-D--122021.png 1600w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/12/Slide-D--122021.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Unlike tracking protection from the major browsers, we block hidden trackers <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/browser-privacy-protection/">before they load</a>. Most tracking protection just restricts trackers after they load, which can still leak your information.</p><p>Sometimes trackers aren&#x2019;t exactly hidden though: they can also be associated with embedded content on pages, like posts, comments, and other content from Facebook. This year our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app">browser extension</a> got a new feature that identifies this content from Facebook, blocks it on websites before it loads, and gives users the choice to load the content if &#xA0;they want to. Extension users have <a href="https://twitter.com/savortheharvest/status/1441046813251932163">loved</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ITLWorldwide/status/1405408755404181507">this</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/designcomputing/status/1412543567738798084">update</a> since it gives them more privacy and transparency at the same time, and we plan to both expand on it and bring it to our mobile app in 2022.</p><p>We also spent a lot of time this year ensuring our tracker blocking doesn&#x2019;t break sites by setting up and launching a continuous process to receive and react to breakage feedback from users in real-time. In addition, we continued to strengthen our core <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/">Tracker Radar data set</a> through more crawling and testing, including looking out for CNAME cloaking (where third-parties pretend they are first-parties). We also rolled out <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/global-privacy-control-enabled-by-default/">Global Privacy Control</a> across all platforms and maintained our best-in-class <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/global-privacy-control-enabled-by-default/">Smarter Encryption</a> data set.</p><p></p><p><strong>Mobile App: Burn, Flush, or Blow Private Data Away</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/12/E--Fire-Button.v3.gif" class="kg-image" alt="DuckDuckGo in 2021: Building the Privacy Super App" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"></figure><p>According to our conversations with users, one of the things they love most about our mobile app for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/duckduckgo-privacy-browser/id663592361">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a> is our Fire Button. Who wouldn&#x2019;t love the feeling of clearing all your tabs and browsing data with one fiery tap? This year we added new animation options to the Fire Button so now instead of burning your data, you can choose to flush it down a virtual drain or watch it get blown away!</p><p>In addition, some other app improvements we made this year include adding a &#x201C;Fireproofing&#x201D; prompt so you have the choice to keep certain sites logged in between burns, a new setting to change font sizes on web content, simplifying the search bar (so there aren&#x2019;t two search bars when on our search pages), and speeding up loading time on Android.</p><p></p><p><strong>Desktop App: The Privacy, Speed, and Simplicity of our Mobile App Comes to Desktop</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/12/Slide-F--122020--E.png" class="kg-image" alt="DuckDuckGo in 2021: Building the Privacy Super App" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Slide-F--122020--E.png 600w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/Slide-F--122020--E.png 1000w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/12/Slide-F--122020--E.png 1600w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/12/Slide-F--122020--E.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Like we&#x2019;ve done on mobile, DuckDuckGo for desktop will redefine user expectations of everyday online privacy. No complicated settings, no misleading warnings, no &#x201C;levels&#x201D; of privacy protection &#x2013; just robust privacy protection that works by default, across search, browsing, email, and more. It&apos;s not a &quot;privacy browser&quot;; it&apos;s an everyday browsing app that respects your privacy because there&apos;s never a bad time to stop companies from spying on your search and browsing history.</p><p>Instead of forking Chromium or anything else, we&#x2019;re building our desktop app around the OS-provided rendering engines (like on mobile), allowing us to strip away a lot of the unnecessary cruft and clutter that&#x2019;s accumulated over the years in major browsers. With our clean and simple interface combined with the beloved Fire Button from our mobile app, DuckDuckGo for desktop will be ready to become your new everyday browsing app. &#xA0;Compared to Chrome, the DuckDuckGo app for desktop is cleaner, way more private, and early tests have found it significantly faster too!</p>

<ul><li>DuckDuckGo is launching <strong>App Tracking Protection for Android</strong> into beta, a new feature in our <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android">existing app</a> that will <strong>block third-party trackers like Google and Facebook lurking in other apps</strong>.</li><li><strong>Join the private waitlist</strong> from our <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android">Android app</a> today and help shape the future of App Tracking Protection!</li></ul><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/11/ATPS-2.jpeg" alt="Introducing App Tracking Protection for Android: The easiest way to block trackers lurking in your apps"><p>You&#x2019;ve probably heard about companies tracking you behind the scenes on smartphone apps they don&#x2019;t own (like <a href="https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.nike.omega/latest/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google hiding in the Nike app</a>). These hidden app trackers are super creepy because they can track everything you do in an app and also can continue to track you even when you&#x2019;re not using the app. Many of these trackers are designed to record your activity <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">in real time</a>: where you are, what you&#x2019;re doing, where you&#x2019;ve been, and even how many hours you sleep at night.</p><p>Across all your apps, your personal data is being sent to dozens of third-party companies, thousands of times per week. This data enables tracking networks like Facebook and Google to create even more detailed digital profiles on you. With those profiles, tracking networks can manipulate what you see online, target you with ads based on your behavior, and even sell your data to other companies like <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90310803/here-are-the-data-brokers-quietly-buying-and-selling-your-personal-information" rel="noreferrer noopener">data brokers</a>, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/location-tracking-whistleblower-reveals-info-on-companies-buying-and-selling-your-location-data/" rel="noreferrer noopener">advertisers</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244848/us-intelligence-memo-admits-buying-smartphone-location-data" rel="noreferrer noopener">governments</a>.</p><p>Over 96% of the popular free Android apps we tested (based on <a href="https://androidrank.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">AndroidRank.org</a> rankings) contained hidden third-party trackers. Of those, 87% sent data to Google and 68% sent data to Facebook. A <a href="https://blog.appcensus.io/2020/11/18/snapshot-of-privacy-behaviors-in-the-australian-android-app-ecosystem/" rel="noreferrer noopener">report by AppCensus</a> found similar results.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/11/01---Apps-Tracking.v6-1.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Introducing App Tracking Protection for Android: The easiest way to block trackers lurking in your apps" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"><figcaption><em>Companies hide trackers in your apps that can capture personal information.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Recently Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212025" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> App Tracking Transparency, a feature for iPhones and iPads that asks users in each app whether they want to allow third-party app tracking or not, with the <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-idfa-app-tracking-transparency-weekly/" rel="noreferrer noopener">vast majority of people opting-out</a>. However, most smartphone users worldwide use Android, where no similar feature exists. In fact, advertisers are now <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/as-att-hits-critical-mass-media-spending-see-saw-from-ios-to-android-continues/" rel="noreferrer noopener">spending more money</a> on Android apparently because it&#x2019;s now easier to track you there. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re excited to announce the beta of App Tracking Protection for Android!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><style> .pill { -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; display: inline-block; padding: 3px 4px 2px; font-size: .5em; background: #FDD20A; border-radius: 2px; position: relative; top: -4px; } </style> <h3>DuckDuckGo App Tracking Protection for Android. <span class="pill"> BETA</span></h3> <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>App Tracking Protection for Android is free and blocks trackers it identifies in other apps from third-party companies (those different from the company that owns each app). It is now built right into the DuckDuckGo Android app.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/11/02---Activity-Report.v5B-1-1-1.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Introducing App Tracking Protection for Android: The easiest way to block trackers lurking in your apps" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"><figcaption><em>Protection from app trackers, even while you sleep.</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3><p>After enabling App Tracking Protection, the DuckDuckGo app will detect when your Android apps are about to send data to third-party tracking companies found in our app tracker dataset, and block those requests. You can enjoy your apps as you normally would and App Tracking Protection will run in the background and continue to block the detected trackers throughout your apps, even while you sleep. We are continually working to identify and protect against new trackers, so you can rest easy knowing you&#x2019;re getting the most up-to-date protection.</p><p>App Tracking Protection is not a virtual private network (VPN), though your device will recognize it as one. This is because App Tracking Protection uses a local &#x201C;VPN connection&#x201D; which means that it works its magic right on your smartphone. However, App Tracking Protection is different from VPNs because it never routes app data through an external server.</p><p>Directly from the DuckDuckGo app, you can see a real time view of App Tracking Protection blocking trackers as well as which tracking networks they tried to send data to. If you have notifications on, you&#x2019;ll also get automatic summaries.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/11/03---Notification.v5-1-1-1.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Introducing App Tracking Protection for Android: The easiest way to block trackers lurking in your apps" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"><figcaption><em>Daily App Tracking Protection summary</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id="join-the-private-beta-waitlist">Join the private beta waitlist.</h3><p>To get access to the beta of App Tracking Protection, join the private waitlist! We&apos;re letting new people in every week, so the sooner you join, the sooner you&apos;ll be protecting your app privacy.</p><p>You won&#x2019;t need to share any personal information to join the private waitlist. Instead, you&#x2019;ll secure your place in line with a date and time that exists solely on your device, and we&#x2019;ll notify you when we&#x2019;re ready for you to join.</p><ol><li>Download DuckDuckGo for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android</a> (or update to the latest version).</li><li>Open Settings &gt; App Tracking Protection (in the Privacy section).</li><li>Click &#x201C;Join the Private Waitlist.&#x201D;</li></ol><h3 id="we-want-to-hear-from-you">We want to hear from you.</h3><p>We decided to release App Tracking Protection in beta while we work on getting the experience just right. While it&#x2019;s in beta, there are a small number of apps being excluded because they rely on tracking to work properly. We hope to reduce this list even further over time.&#x200C;&#x200C; &#x200C;&#x200C;For general feedback or issues with the DuckDuckGo app: open Settings &gt; Share Feedback (in the Other section). &#x200C;&#x200C;&#x200C;&#x200C;If you run into issues with another app on your smartphone as a result of App Tracking Protection (e.g., videos don&#x2019;t load properly, you cannot upload/send files, you experience download problems, the app feels sluggish, etc.), you can disable protection for just that app under Manage Protections for Your Apps. You&apos;ll then be asked to give details of the problem you experienced.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/11/04B---Protection-v3B-1-1.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Introducing App Tracking Protection for Android: The easiest way to block trackers lurking in your apps" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"><figcaption><em>Disable protection and report issues for other apps</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you&#x2019;re an Android user who has been waiting for a feature to block hidden third-party trackers in your apps, the wait is almost over. With one download of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android">DuckDuckGo app</a> you&#x2019;ll soon be able to block app trackers detected by App Tracking Protection while also getting the other protections available from our all-in-one privacy app: private search, website protection, email protection, and more. These multiple layers of protection enable you to go about your daily online activities with more peace of mind, knowing you&#x2019;re more protected.</p>

We do of course also care about our impact offline, and so we&apos;ve stepped up to do our part in the climate crisis. We have already been doing what we can to minimize our carbon footprint including <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/sustainability/#overview">using sustainable energy</a> to power our servers and being a fully distributed company.</p> <p>Today, we&#x2019;re proud to announce DuckDuckGo is now carbon negative dating back to our founding in 2008 through 2020, and we are committed to being carbon negative in perpetuity.</p> <p>When we set out to do this, we quickly realized there isn&apos;t much guidance for companies like ours that have 100% distributed teams and provide non-physical goods and services. We hope our experience figuring this out can be a reference guide for similar organizations. Here&#x2019;s the summary:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Redefining the Scope.</strong> We defined our carbon footprint in the broadest possible sense, including all of our suppliers and vendors (in carbon language that means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_accounting#Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol_(GHGP)">Scopes 1, 2, &amp; 3</a>, as well as any other upstream/downstream activities we could find). This means we estimated the total impact of all search queries using our search engine, all our marketing (including the carbon used when viewing our online display ads), and, given we are a fully distributed company, the impact of all our local working environments.</li> <li><strong>Estimating Emissions.</strong> We estimated not only for 2020, but back-estimated to our founding in 2008.</li> <li><strong>Net Zero Emissions.</strong> We then funded <a href="https://www.goldstandard.org/">Gold Standard</a> projects to achieve net zero emissions. The projects are committed to improving the lives of the people involved in the supported projects in addition to more rigorously measuring their carbon reductions.</li> <li><strong>Going Carbon Negative.</strong> Then to go carbon negative, we first funded an additional 25% of reduction (for 125% of our emissions). We then doubled this dollar amount and spent the second half on <a href="https://stripe.com/climate">Stripe Climate</a> to help build a much-needed market for carbon removal, which is necessary to combat climate change at scale.</li> </ul> <p>We will use this blueprint for 2021 and beyond.</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="redefiningthescope">Redefining the Scope</h2> <p>We set out to calculate our carbon footprint using the commonly used <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/">Greenhouse Gas Protocol</a>. The Protocol groups emissions into three &#x201C;scopes&#x201D; and additional activities:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Scope 1:</strong> Direct emissions, e.g., emitted by factories or vehicles you own.</li> <li><strong>Scope 2:</strong> Indirect emissions from purchasing energy, e.g., buying electricity for or heating and cooling your buildings.</li> <li><strong>Scope 3:</strong> Other indirect emissions from making products and services, e.g., from purchased materials, business travel, etc.</li> <li><strong>Full Upstream/Downstream Activities:</strong> Other emissions not covered so far in the full lifecycle of your products and services, e.g., distribution, storage, and disposal, sometimes covered in Scope 3 definitions and sometimes not.</li> </ul> <p>Many companies who claim they are &#x201C;carbon neutral&#x201D; are often only looking at their Scope 1 or Scope 1 &amp; 2 emissions, even though Scope 3 and Full Upstream/Downstream Activities are often where the vast majority of emissions take place, especially for organizations not producing or processing physical goods.</p> <p>In addition, many organizations only look at activities where clear guidelines have been defined (e.g., air travel), but ignore areas where there are no guidelines (e.g., impact of marketing, home offices, etc.), even if much of the organization&#x2019;s carbon emissions are the result of these activities.</p> <p>At DuckDuckGo we didn&apos;t think the standard went far enough, so we redefined our approach to make us responsible for all emissions we cause that are not already net zero, regardless of their categorization (or lack thereof).</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="estimatingemissions">Estimating Emissions</h2> <p>To estimate our emissions, we pulled together leading source material from environmental agencies around the world including the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69554/pb13773-ghg-conversion-factors-2012.pdf">UK DEFRA / DEEC 2012 GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting</a>, the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-03/documents/emission-factors_mar_2018_0.pdf">EPA&apos;s 2018 Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories Report</a>, the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/904215/2019-ghg-conversion-factors-methodology-v01-02.pdf">BEIS&apos; 2019 Government Greenhouse Gas Conversion Factors for Company Reporting Methodology Paper</a>, and the <a href="http://docs.assets.eco.on.ca/reports/other-publications/Reducing-My-Footprint.pdf">Environmental Commission of Ontario&apos;s 2019 Climate Pollution Report</a>. From here, we mapped out the carbon footprint of every single transaction on our books for the entire 2019 calendar year (since we started working on this in mid-2020), and used that to build a model to estimate category emissions per accounting transaction. That means every vendor bill and credit card purchase by a team member.</p> <p>While some transactions fit into standard models developed by government agencies (e.g., air travel), it turns out that to our knowledge, no one in government has ever calculated the carbon emissions of an online display advertisement. So, in cases where there was no standard model, or we felt a standard model clearly under-estimated the actual carbon footprint, we developed our own formulas.</p> <p>This led to us estimating some currently unorthodox emissions including:</p> <ul> <li>The hardware and software our staff use in their home offices.</li> <li>A proportional amount of heating/cooling used in each home office during the work day.</li> <li>The fuel used in the Lyft they take to a partnership meeting.</li> <li>The emissions that stem from our marketing (both online and offline), such as showing a display ad on a user&apos;s computer.</li> <li>The amount of emissions generated from each DuckDuckGo Search query itself.</li> </ul> <p>We then surveyed our team to better understand their home-office/co-working situations, including the hardware and software they use, their work-related transit, and recorded all this usage as if it were regular direct Scope 1 emissions.</p> <p>Lastly, we checked for the sustainability programs of every single vendor we used or had made a corporate purchase from in any capacity. Where one couldn&apos;t be identified, or where the program clearly failed to account for 100% of their carbon emissions, we recorded the full CO2e emissions from those transactions as our own.</p> <p>In the end, our estimate for our 2019 emissions &#x2014; including Scope 1, 2, 3, and Full Upstream/Downstream Activities &#x2014; totaled 1,075T of CO2e. That works out to 14.33T of CO2e/per year/per full-time team member on average, which we used to calculate a total of 5,875T of CO2e for the entire existence of DuckDuckGo back to our 2008 founding through 2020.</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="netzeroemissions">Net Zero Emissions</h2> <p>Once we felt our carbon emissions were properly estimated, we set out to understand how we could properly achieve net zero emissions in a way that would:</p> <ul> <li>Directly reduce carbon.</li> <li>Not come at other environmental costs.</li> <li>Respect and improve human life.</li> </ul> <p>After an extensive review of our options, we ended up partnering with GoldStandard.org, an international non-profit foundation that is focused on reducing carbon emissions through sustainable investment in carbon reduction projects that also help improve the lives of those involved. In their words these projects &quot;make a net-positive contribution to the economic, environmental and social welfare of the local population that hosts it, in the form of contributions to a minimum of three <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>.&#x201D;</p> <p>We are funding Gold Standard projects to account for 125% of our estimated emissions, which through 2020 amounted to 7,343T. These projects included:</p> <ul> <li>Funding biomass generators in India, Malawi, Kenya, and biodigesters in Cambodia to bring safe, clean, self-reliant energy to small rural farming villages.</li> <li>Funding new wind farms in India and Indonesia, to provide clean energy to regions currently dependent on coal burning electricity.</li> <li>Providing solar cooking stoves in Chad, and improved clean efficiency stoves in Guinea and Rwanda, to end coal burning pollution and help protect families from inhaling toxic fumes when cooking in the home.</li> <li>Funding hydroelectric power in Honduras, and renewable energy in Brazil.</li> <li>Supporting biomass conservation and local biodiversity reforestation in Nicaragua and Ethiopia to help local farmers and conservationists rebuild soil that is suffering from desertification due to deforestation.</li> </ul> <p>The full list of these projects and credits can be validated on the <a href="https://registry.goldstandard.org/credit-blocks?q=Gold+Standard+Marketplace+Order+for+DuckDuckGo&amp;page=1">GoldStandard.org Impact Registry</a>. We&apos;re proud that DuckDuckGo is not only achieving net zero emissions, but doing so in a way that we hope will have a transformative and on-going impact around the world, creating jobs and improving the health and quality of life for many.</p> <blockquote> <p>&#x201C;We applaud DuckDuckGo for taking full responsibility for their climate impact, including harder-to-measure Scope 3 emissions, by supporting high-impact, community-based Gold Standard projects. Beyond that, DuckDuckGo is financing climate mitigation that&#x2019;s more expensive today in a bid to bring down the cost curve for future scaling &#x2013; this is in the spirit of the WWF Blueprint for Climate and Nature, and a model for others to follow.&#x201D;<br> &#x2013; Gold Standard Chief Executive Officer, Margaret Kim</p> </blockquote> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="goingcarbonnegative">Going Carbon Negative</h2> <p>Addressing the climate crisis requires us to collectively get to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-emissions-kemp-idUSKBN2BW21Q">net zero global emissions</a>. We believe doing so will require the use of new technologies at scale such as physically removing carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it permanently. Unfortunately, this technology is too expensive right now to make an impact at scale.</p> <p>That&apos;s why we are proud we were one of the first companies to join <a href="https://stripe.com/en-us/climate">Stripe&apos;s Climate Program</a> to bring down the cost of this technology by making commitments to fund this new type of carbon reduction. Unlike other carbon reduction methods, Stripe&apos;s program requires that all carbon removal has a permanence of greater than a thousand years, is directly measured and verifiable, and has a net-negative lifecycle ratio of less than one.</p> <p>While the program is normally only available for Stripe customers, DuckDuckGo is pleased to work directly with Stripe and has committed that every year, whatever amount of money we spend on Gold Standard projects, we will make an equal dollar contribution to Stripe&apos;s climate program to help directly remove carbon from the air, and more importantly, help pull this technology forward.</p> <blockquote> <p>&#x201C;We launched Stripe Climate to make it easy for any business to support high-potential carbon removal technologies.

You may be surprised to learn that <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2017/09/28/i-never-signed-up-for-this-privacy-implications-of-email-tracking/">70% of emails contain trackers</a> that can detect <em>when</em> you&#x2019;ve opened a message, <em>where</em> you were when you opened it, and <em>what</em> device you were using. If that isn&#x2019;t creepy enough, this email data can be used to <a href="https://senglehardt.com/papers/pets18_email_tracking.pdf">profile you</a>, including to target you with ads, and influence the content you see online. Ever open an email and see a related ad about it soon thereafter? Yup, blame email trackers. This data about you is also usually sent directly to third parties, most likely without your consent.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/06/1-Pixels-v6.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Introducing Email Protection: The easy way to block email trackers and hide your address" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"><figcaption>Companies hide trackers in your emails that can capture personal information.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="introducing-email-protection">Introducing Email Protection</h2><p>We&#x2019;re excited to announce the beta release of DuckDuckGo&#x2019;s Email Protection. Our free email forwarding service removes email trackers and protects the privacy of your personal email address without asking you to change email services or apps. Most existing email privacy solutions come with significant tradeoffs. You either have to switch email services or apps entirely, or degrade your email experience by hiding all images. We believe protecting your personal information from leaking to third parties should be simple and seamless, like the rest of DuckDuckGo&#x2019;s privacy protection bundle.</p><h2 id="email-privacy-simplified-">Email privacy, simplified.</h2><p><strong>Choose your Duck Email Address (you@duck.com) and start giving it out. </strong>We remove hidden trackers from incoming emails sent to this address, then forward them to your regular inbox for safer reading. This means if you use an email service like Gmail or Yahoo, it&#x2019;s no problem! &#xA0;Emails sent to your Personal Duck Address will arrive there as usual so you can read your email like normal, in any app or on the web, worry-free.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/06/4---Proof-of-Trackers.v4.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Introducing Email Protection: The easy way to block email trackers and hide your address" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"><figcaption>We forward your emails after removing trackers. Same inbox, more privacy.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Get automatic Email Protection in the app. </strong>The DuckDuckGo app and extension provide easy access to your Personal Duck Address when browsing the web and also give you the option to generate new Private Duck Addresses on demand.</p><p>On sites you think could spam you or share your email address, a Private Duck Address will protect you. Since it&#x2019;s common for sites to upload your email address to Google and Facebook for ad targeting, or for your email to be leaked in a data breach, this extra level of identity protection is now unfortunately necessary. You can think of it as similar to not reusing the same password everywhere. We&#x2019;ve also made Private Duck Addresses easy to deactivate, so there&#x2019;s no stress if you start receiving too much spam.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/06/3---Autofill.v5.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Introducing Email Protection: The easy way to block email trackers and hide your address" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"><figcaption>Use a Private Duck Address when you don&apos;t trust a site to keep your information to themselves.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="we-don-t-save-your-emails-">We don&apos;t save your emails.</h2><p>We believe the content of your emails is none of our business, so DuckDuckGo will never save your emails for this service.

This series has focused on many aspects of a properly designed search preference menu such as <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/search-preference-menu-design/">visual design</a>, <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/search-preference-menus-scrolling/">including all eligible search engines</a>, and <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/search-preference-menu-auctions/">not charging search engines to appear</a>.</p><p><strong>Another key aspect is that competing search engines should have an easy way to guide consumers to the search preference menu.</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/05/Default-Concept--051221.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Search Engines Should be Able to Guide Consumers to Search Preference Menus" loading="lazy" width="1440" height="1080" srcset="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/Default-Concept--051221.jpg 600w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/Default-Concept--051221.jpg 1000w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/05/Default-Concept--051221.jpg 1440w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Proposal for search engine guided launch path to preference menu.</figcaption></figure><p>Right now, for example, Google&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen/">search preference menu in Europe</a> is shown to consumers just once, on initial device setup. Believe or not, the only way to get back to it thereafter is to erase all data on the device through a hard &#x201C;factory reset,&#x201D; returning the device to an initial device setup state.</p><p>That means, for all practical purposes, if you want to change your default device search engine again easily, you can&#x2019;t. You&#x2019;re back to the over-15-clicks method, which we know from experience trips up almost everyone. In other words, one click competition becomes in fact &quot;one factory reset away.&quot; The only reasons we can think of for setting up a preference menu this way are anti-competitive ones.</p><p>The sensible approach is to give users an easy pathway to the search preference menu by letting them tap a link from a search engine app or website within the default browser (e.g., Chrome). With that simple tap, the user is whisked directly to the search preference menu.</p><p>Not allowing competing search engines to easily guide consumers back to the search preference menu is a pretty big <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/roach-motel">dark pattern</a> because it is requiring users to make an important choice when they often aren&#x2019;t ready to do so, and then not giving them the option to easily change their mind later while using a competing search engine. </p><p>When setting up a device, a user goes through over a dozen screens and may not be in the frame of mind to change their search engine. By contrast, they are much more likely to select an alternative after they just downloaded a search engine&#x2019;s app or navigated to their website.</p><p>So, to anyone considering implementing a search preference menu, or drafting regulations covering search preference menus, please ensure that consumers can access it at any time, especially after a consumer has just chosen to use a competing search engine. That is, just showing it during onboarding and including additional access via device settings is not enough because of the power of defaults, and, from our experience, it is difficult for consumers to navigate the many layers of device setting menus. </p><p>Functionality that allows competing search engines to guide consumers directly to the preference menu is necessary for consumer empowerment and search market competition.</p><hr><p><em>For more privacy advice <a href="https://twitter.com/duckduckgo">follow us on Twitter</a>, and stay protected and informed with our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter">privacy newsletters</a>.</em></p>

It detects unencrypted (HTTP) connections to websites and automatically upgrades them to encrypted (HTTPS) connections when possible, keeping your personal data like your search terms, the exact pages you visit, and anything you type into a website private from possible network snoopers.</p> <p>Today, we&#x2019;re proud to announce another milestone bringing our best-in-class privacy protection technology to millions more people: The <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</a> is incorporating data from Smarter Encryption into their <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere browser extension</a>. EFF has been defending digital rights and privacy for over 30 years and Smarter Encryption itself was inspired by their pioneering work.</p> <p>When Smarter Encryption launched, out of the gate it was far more comprehensive than similar technologies because it is automatically generated by crawling the web, and re-crawling continuously to ensure that users don&apos;t face any breakage when websites change. This automated process has enabled us to keep up with the growing number of websites adopting HTTPS solutions such as <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#x2019;s Encrypt</a> (co-founded by EFF, Mozilla and University of Michigan) &#x2013; something that has become increasingly difficult for maintainers of crowd-sourced approaches. On DuckDuckGo Search, for example, the full Smarter Encryption dataset derived from our automatic crawling now covers around 90% of all website clicks from search results.</p> <p>If you have the HTTPS Everywhere extension installed in your browser, you don&#x2019;t need to do anything and shouldn&apos;t notice anything different other than seamlessly enjoying even greater encryption protection. You can of course also make use of the technology by using the DuckDuckGo <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app">app/extension</a> or by simply starting your web searches on <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo Search</a>.</p> <p>If you&#x2019;d like to use the Smarter Encryption <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/smarter-encryption">code</a> or <a href="https://staticcdn.duckduckgo.com/https/smarter_encryption_latest.tgz">dataset</a> yourself, non-commercial users are free to do so under the Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a> license.

When we started the project, the vast majority of the internet was not protected. Now it is, and preserving and completing that work is vital for us all. There is no group better suited to do this than DuckDuckGo.&#x201D;<br> &#x2013; Jon Callas, EFF Director of Technology Projects</p> </blockquote> <p>We think everyone deserves simple privacy protection, which is why we build privacy technology like <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-smarter-encryption/">Smarter Encryption</a> and <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/">Tracker Radar</a>, making it easy for people to take back their privacy without sacrifice. We&#x2019;re delighted we are now more closely working with EFF to further this mission.</p> <p>Note: Google recently announced their plan to use HTTPS by default in Chrome for direct navigation. That means it only affects website addresses (URLs) typed directly into the address bar that do not have an &quot;http://&quot; or &quot;https://&quot; prefix. It should not be confused with the greater protection Smarter Encryption provides, which covers all clicks and interactions as you browse the web, including clicks from social media, search engines, and other websites.</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><hr><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><em>For more privacy advice <a href="https://twitter.com/duckduckgo">follow us on Twitter</a>, and stay protected and informed with our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter">privacy newsletters</a>.</em></p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown-->

Use the DuckDuckGo Extension to Block FLoC, Google’s New Tracking Method in Chrome
</title>
<description>
Google has created a new tracking mechanism called FLoC, put it in Chrome, and automatically turned it on for millions of users. It's bad for privacy, which is why we're now blocking it in the DuckDuckGo extension.

It groups you based on your interests and demographics, derived from your browsing history, to enable creepy advertising and other content targeting without third-party cookies. After a short trial period, Google decided not to make this new tracking method a user choice and instead started <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/google-testing-its-controversial-new-ad-targeting-tech-millions-browsers-heres">automatically including millions in the scheme</a>. If you&apos;re reading this in Chrome while logged in to a Google account, yes, that likely means you too, and if not now, then eventually.</p> <h3>As a user, what can I do to avoid this?</h3> <p>The criteria for being opted into FLoC are <a href="https://github.com/WICG/floc#qualifying-users-for-whom-a-cohort-will-be-logged-with-their-sync-data">somewhat</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/privacy/whitepaper.html#signin">hidden</a> and conflicting, but there are three methods for blocking FLoC:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Don&apos;t use Google Chrome!</strong> Right now FLoC is only in Google Chrome, and no other browser vendor has expressed an intention or even interest to implement it. There are various browsers that are free to download, and we recommend some in our <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/how-to-remove-google/">guide to Google alternatives</a>. On <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/duckduckgo-privacy-browser/id663592361">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android">Android</a> we suggest you use our own mobile browser, which offers best-in-class privacy protection by default when searching and browsing.</li> <li><strong>Install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg">DuckDuckGo Chrome extension</a>.</strong> In response to Google automatically turning on FLoC, we&apos;ve enhanced the tracker blocking in our Chrome extension to also block FLoC interactions on websites. This is directly in line with the single purpose of our extension of protecting your privacy holistically as you use your browser. It&#x2019;s privacy, simplified. (If you use a non-Chrome browser, you can get our extension <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app">here</a>.) The FLoC blocking feature is included in version 2021.4.8 and newer of the DuckDuckGo extension, which should auto-update, though you can also check the version you have installed from the extensions list within Chrome.</li> <li>Change your Chrome and/or Google settings, which we recommend you do in any case if you continue to use Chrome. It seems (but Google isn&apos;t very clear about this so we aren&apos;t certain) that if you perform any of the following, then Google will exclude you from FLoC, at least for the time being. And as there are still many unknowns and things are changing rapidly, the effectiveness of these steps may change in future. <ul> <li>Stay logged out of your Google account;</li> <li><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/185277">Don&apos;t sync your history data with Chrome</a>, or <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/165139?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en#zippy=%2Ccreate-a-passphrase">create a sync passphrase</a>;</li> <li>In <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols">Google Activity Controls</a>, disable &#x201C;Web &amp; App Activity&#x201D; or &#x201C;Include Chrome history and activity from sites, apps, and devices that use Google services;&#x201D;</li> <li>In <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/">Google Ad Settings</a> disable &#x201C;Ad Personalization&#x201D; or &#x201C;Also use your activity &amp; information from Google services to personalize ads on websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.&#x201D;</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Note that even if you change these settings, we also recommend installing the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg">DuckDuckGo Chrome extension</a> to get holistic privacy protection when using Chrome, including <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">private search</a>, <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/">tracker blocking</a>, <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-smarter-encryption/">Smarter Encryption</a>, and <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/global-privacy-control-enabled-by-default/">Global Privacy Control</a>. For non-Chrome desktop browsers, you can get our extension <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app">here</a>.</p> <h3>So, what is FLoC anyway?</h3> <p>With browsers dropping support for third-party cookies, FLoC is Google&apos;s approach for replacing them. It&apos;s being <a href="https://github.com/WICG/floc">developed in the open</a> and is claimed by Google to be good for privacy. However, it has received widespread criticism from privacy experts, including from EFF who say <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">it&apos;s a &quot;terrible idea&quot;</a> and implored Google &quot;please don&apos;t do this.&quot; We agree with their assessment, and, in a world where it does exist, it should be explicitly opt-in for users (free of dark patterns). In addition, while Google isn&#x2019;t phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome until at least 2023, FLoC is already live today in 2021.</p> <h3>What are some of those privacy concerns with FLoC?</h3> <p>With FLoC, by simply browsing the web, you are automatically placed into a group based on your browsing history (&#x201C;cohort&#x201D;). Websites you visit will immediately be able to access this group FLoC ID and use it to target ads or content at you. It&apos;s like walking into a store where they already know all about you! In addition, while FLoC is purported to be more private because it is a group, combined with your IP address (which also gets automatically sent to websites) you can continue to be tracked easily as an individual.</p> <p>Google itself maintains detailed profiles of users, built up over time from what they&apos;ve learned about users (including through passive trackers <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/">lurking on most websites</a>), but with FLoC they&apos;re now exposing your derived interests and demographics from this profile to the websites you visit via FLoC IDs. Although the cohorts you belong to over time are non-descriptive and represented by an anonymous-looking number, it won&apos;t be long before people or organizations work out what FLoC IDs really mean, e.g. what interests and demographic information they are likely correlated with.</p> <p>But don&apos;t just take it from us. Google itself has said this new approach is <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/the-industry-reacts-to-googles-bold-claim-that-flocs-are-95-as-effective-as-cookies/">at least 95% as effective</a> as third-party cookie tracking, continuing the ability to target people based on age, gender, ethnicity, income, and many other factors. This targeting, regardless of how it&apos;s done, enables manipulation, discrimination, and filter bubbles that many people would like to avoid.</p> <p>Please also note that FLoC IDs will also be accessible by third-party trackers lurking on websites. As <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/browser-privacy-protection/">we&#x2019;ve explained recently</a>, to protect yourself from these trackers, you need to stop them from loading in your browser, which is also accomplished by the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app">DuckDuckGo extension and app</a>.</p> <h3>As a website owner, what can I do to avoid this?</h3> <p>Websites can take steps to protect the privacy of their users by opting out of FLoC, which would be applicable to all their visitors. It&apos;s done by simply sending the following <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/permissions-policy-1/#introduction">Permissions-Policy</a> HTTP response header:</p> <p><em>Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()</em></p> <p>Some publishers like <a href="https://themarkup.org/">The Markup</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/">The Guardian</a> have <a href="https://twitter.com/JuliaAngwin/status/1379812115800854534">already done so</a>, as have we at <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo Search</a>, and we encourage others to follow.</p> <h3>What&#x2019;s next?</h3> <p>We&apos;re disappointed that, despite the many publicly voiced concerns with FLoC that have not yet been addressed, Google is already forcing FLoC upon users without explicitly asking them to opt in. We&apos;re nevertheless committed and will continue to do our part to deliver on our vision of raising the standard of trust online.</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><hr><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><em>For more privacy advice <a href="https://twitter.com/duckduckgo">follow us on Twitter</a>, and stay protected and informed with our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter">privacy newsletters</a>.</em></p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown-->

For example, you may have been hearing about how even Google&#x2019;s Chrome browser is <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html">supposedly planning</a> to eliminate &#x201C;third-party cookies&quot; by 2023, a move Apple&#x2019;s Safari browser has already <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/">mostly carried out</a> and Mozilla&#x2019;s Firefox browser has <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop#w_what-enhanced-tracking-protection-blocks">partially made</a>.</p> <p>You may be wondering then, will eliminating third-party cookies and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">related developments</a> completely prevent trackers that are <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/">lurking behind websites</a> from getting your browsing history? Unfortunately, the answer is no. We know this is super confusing and would like to help you make sense of it all as well as help you actually block these invasive cross-site trackers!</p> <p>The issue is that once such trackers are loaded in your browser, they have a ton of ways to track you beyond just third-party cookies (e.g., by another form of cookies called <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40520040/understanding-google-analytics-first-party-cookies">first-party cookies</a>, by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380161">your IP address</a>, and <a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">much, much more</a>). And many of these mechanisms cannot be turned off because the browser needs them to properly function.</p> <p>Blocking third-party cookies and related mechanisms do partially restrict cross-site trackers (which is a good thing for sure), but the reality is that as long as a tracker is still being loaded in your browser, it can definitely still track you &#x2014; a bit less easily, but tracking is still tracking, and the most prevalent cross-site trackers (those <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2020/02/most-common-trackers-on-websites3.png">from Google and Facebook</a>) are certainly still tracking you. In this context, browser privacy tech that just restricts trackers after they have loaded is like using an umbrella in a hurricane: You&#x2019;re still gonna get wet!</p> <p>Therefore, to really stop a cross-site tracker, the kind that tries to track your activity from site to site, you have to prevent it from actually loading in your browser in the first place. This is a critical blocking feature that we provide in our all-in-one privacy browser extension for desktop <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/caoacbimdbbljakfhgikoodekdnlcgpk">Edge</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/duckduckgo-privacy-essentials/id1482920575">Safari</a>, as well as in our own mobile browser for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duckduckgo-privacy-browser/id663592361">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android">Android</a>.</p> <p>Blocking trackers from even loading also has major benefits beyond privacy: increased speed and less data usage. In our tests on a sample web page (WebMD.com), using our tracker blocking resulted in 66% fewer files loading, 34% less data transferred, and, consequently, increasing page load speed by 46% (see bottom section for details).</p> <p>To sum up, to really stop trackers, you need to totally block them from loading in your browser &#x2014; just placing restrictions on trackers after they load (like preventing them from using third-party cookies) won&apos;t cut it. That&apos;s the story in a nutshell, and below is more detail if you want to dig deeper, including how you can see it working in your own browser.</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="howcrosssitewebtrackerswork">How Cross-Site Web Trackers Work</h2> <p>To dig in a bit further, let&#x2019;s define a cross-site web tracker as anything that can load on a web page to track your web activity across sites, e.g., your browsing history. To do so, a cross-site web tracker has to do three things:</p> <ol> <li>Grab your information.</li> <li>Associate your information with your unique ID at the tracking company (behind the tracker).</li> <li>Send your information back to the tracking company for future profiling.</li> </ol> <p>When you go to a website, it loads the web address (URL) at the top of the browser. What you may not realize, though, is that websites also ask your browser to load many more web addresses (URLs) in the background, and some of those are to third-party trackers. In Firefox (used in the images below), you can see this by going to Tools -&gt; Web Developer -&gt; Network, and then refreshing the page. (Other browsers have similar mechanisms, e.g., in Chrome you can do the same by going to View -&gt; Developer -&gt; Developer Tools, clicking on Network on the panel that comes up, and then refreshing the page.)</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/02/webmd-trackers-allowed.png" class="kg-image" alt="Most Browser Tracking Protection Doesn&apos;t Actually Stop Tracking by Default, but We Can Help" loading="lazy" width="1392" height="664" srcset="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/webmd-trackers-allowed.png 600w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/webmd-trackers-allowed.png 1000w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/02/webmd-trackers-allowed.png 1392w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Google &amp; Facebook trackers loaded on <a href="https://www.webmd.com/">WebMD.com</a>.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>A visit to <a href="https://www.webmd.com">WebMD.com</a> using the desktop versions of the major browsers with default settings actually results in hundreds of web requests! Many of those are images and code from WebMD itself to display what you see on screen, but among them is a web request to Google Analytics, the most prevalent cross-site tracker on the Internet, lurking behind <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Google-Analytics">72% of the top 10K websites</a>. (The second most prevalent tracker is <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Global-Site-Tag">Google Global Site Tag</a> and third is <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Facebook-Pixel">Facebook Pixel</a>.)</p> <p>When your browser makes this web request to Google Analytics, it exposes <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ip+address&amp;ia=answer">your IP address</a> in the process &#x2013; the string of numbers that identifies your device on the Internet (e.g., 18.250.0.1). Your IP address alone can make a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380161">pretty effective tracking ID</a>, especially in most desktop situations where it doesn&apos;t change frequently because both the device and Internet connection are stable. And embedded information within these types of requests can contain a lot more information about your activity along with other identifiers, which is often why URLs are so long!</p> <p>Once a tracker loads in your browser it has many more ways it can grab information, create unique IDs to identify you (called <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/browser-fingerprinting/">browser fingerprinting</a>), and send everything back to its tracking network. That&#x2019;s because most trackers run JavaScript code, which opens up a whole host of sophisticated tracking techniques that can effectively grab everything you do in the browser, from your mouse movements to your location to every keystroke you enter. And it is impossible to completely restrict all of these techniques because many are needed to make major sites function properly.</p> <p>In other words, third-party cookies are just one of many browser mechanisms available to trackers, but even without them trackers can still track you through many other methods, including via the information sent in the initial loading web request.</p> <p>The United Kingdom&#x2019;s Competition and Markets Authority&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study">landmark report on the digital advertising market</a> makes this clear in <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5fe49554e90e0711ffe07d05/Appendix_G_-_Tracking_and_PETS_v.16_non-confidential_WEB.pdf">Appendix G, section 325</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>&#x201C;However, we note that it is possible to circumvent blocks on third-party cookies, by asking advertisers and publishers to implement equivalent tracking code using first-party cookies.<br> (i) For instance, Google Analytics tags are currently implemented using first-party cookies. (See section above on Google Analytics, Floodlight, and Google Tag Manager.)<br> (ii) To take another example, Facebook Pixel collects data from non-Facebook properties which is used for Facebook&#x2019;s advertising services, and websites can implement Facebook Pixel using first-party cookies. This means Facebook Pixel can work with browsers blocking third-party cookies.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <p>That is, the two most prevalent cross-site trackers aren&apos;t really constrained by current or upcoming default tracker restrictions. The report goes further saying that a world without third-party cookies in particular will likely strengthen Google and Facebook&#x2019;s digital advertising duopoly. Fortunately, there is a way to effectively curtail invasive cross-site web trackers: By stopping them from loading in your browser in the first place.</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="howtoreallystopcrosssitewebtrackers">How to Really Stop Cross-Site Web Trackers</h2> <p>To really stop cross-site web trackers, you need to totally block them from loading in your browser, as opposed to just restricting them after they load. That is the only way to stop the Google Analytics tracker, the Facebook pixel tracker, and hundreds of other trackers from stalking you across the Internet, including through your IP address. By doing so, your browser will then stop automatically sending any of your information to these trackers just by visiting an unrelated website, making it harder for them to use your browsing history for filter bubbles, creepy ads, and more.</p> <p>To use another metaphor, <strong>regular privacy browser tech is like locking the back door of the house (third-party cookies) and a few windows (related restrictions) but leaving the front door wide open (IP address) along with the rest of the windows (many other forms of tracking including first-party cookies).</strong> Google Analytics is doing just fine in this situation, as are most of all the rest of the major trackers. To stop these trackers effectively, <strong>you have to board up the whole house and not let them see inside at all.</strong> Here&#x2019;s what that looks like with our browser extension and in our own browser:</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/02/webmd-trackers-blocked.png" class="kg-image" alt="Most Browser Tracking Protection Doesn&apos;t Actually Stop Tracking by Default, but We Can Help" loading="lazy" width="1391" height="664" srcset="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/webmd-trackers-blocked.png 600w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/webmd-trackers-blocked.png 1000w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/02/webmd-trackers-blocked.png 1391w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Google &amp; Facebook trackers blocked by DuckDuckGo.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We simply prevent the browser from allowing that initial tracker web request to even get off the ground. And, using our <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/">Tracker Radar technology</a>, we are continually crawling the web ourselves to identify the universe of these requests. Our product vision is privacy, simplified, and so we block as many trackers as we can while simultaneously not breaking website functionality. This is of course a constant effort since trackers are continually changing.</p> <p>As you might imagine, this is also a challenging technical problem. Without some additional privacy technology like we provide in our product, blocking some of these hidden trackers &#x2014; like Google Analytics &#x2014; can break some sites based on how tightly they&#x2019;ve been integrated into website functionality. But we think a tracker blocker that doesn&#x2019;t prevent the most prevalent hidden tracker from loading isn&#x2019;t a credible tracker blocker (as Google Analytics is <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Google-Analytics">by far the most prevalent</a>). We are now also starting to work on blocking initial requests of visible third-party content like video embeds, with more to come on that in a future post.</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="howduckduckgoimprovesyourbrowsingexperience">How DuckDuckGo Improves Your Browsing Experience</h2> <p>The result of using the DuckDuckGo <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app">app &amp; extension</a> on a web page is that potentially hundreds of behind-the-scenes tracker requests are blocked before they even load, meaning not just greater privacy but also additional benefits like less data transfer and faster load times. That&apos;s because so much of the data associated with a website nowadays is actually just for tracking you!</p> <img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/03/Visits-to-webMD--032921--B.png" alt="Most Browser Tracking Protection Doesn&apos;t Actually Stop Tracking by Default, but We Can Help" style="width:100%;max-width:800px;"> <table> <thead> <tr> <th></th> <th>Browser-Only Average</th> <th>Browser + DuckDuckGo Extension Average</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Web Requests</td> <td>527</td> <td>181</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Data Transferred (MB)</td> <td>8.1</td> <td>5.4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Page Load Time* (seconds)</td> <td>16.2</td> <td>8.8</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Google Analytics Tracker</td> <td>Allowed to load</td> <td>Blocked from loading</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Facebook Pixel Tracker</td> <td>Allowed to load</td> <td>Blocked from loading</td> </tr> <tr> <td>* <em>Page load time measured using the loadEventEnd property.</em></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>While Google, Facebook, and others work hard to have their trackers get around browser roadblocks in pursuit of your data, we provide the tool to really push back without changing how you use the Internet. For everyone who&#x2019;s had enough: the DuckDuckGo <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app">app &amp; extension</a> lets you take back your online privacy now.</p> <p>Note: Google <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-floc-age-privacy-theater/">recently announced</a> how they plan to replace third-party cookies. It&apos;s of course <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">bad for privacy too</a>, but the tracker blocking technology in our app &amp; extension should continue to be effective at preventing trackers from receiving this new tracking information (along with your IP address) by still preventing them from loading in the first place.</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><hr><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><em>For more privacy advice <a href="https://twitter.com/duckduckgo">follow us on Twitter</a>, and stay protected and informed with our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter">privacy newsletters</a>.</em></p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown-->

That&#x2019;s why we pack our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app">DuckDuckGo mobile apps and browser extensions</a> with so much to keep you private online, including best-in-class <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/">tracker blocking</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">private search</a>, and <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-smarter-encryption/">Smarter Encryption</a>. It&apos;s also why, just a few months ago, <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/announcing-global-privacy-control/">we announced</a> being a founding member of a new standards effort called <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org">Global Privacy Control</a> (GPC), which is a browser or device setting that, when enabled, signals to all visited websites a preference for privacy.</p> <p>While we already block most tracking while browsing, we believe GPC will ultimately provide additional legal protection in certain jurisdictions for situations where websites might otherwise sell or share your data with other companies that may profit or benefit from it (such as selling data you give them to advertisers or data brokers after your visit).</p> <p>Today, <strong>we&#x2019;re turning on the GPC setting by default</strong> in our mobile apps (DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duckduckgo-privacy-browser/id663592361">iOS</a>/<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android">Android</a>) and desktop extensions (DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg">Chrome</a>/<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/">Firefox</a>/<a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/caoacbimdbbljakfhgikoodekdnlcgpk">Edge</a>).</p> <p><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/01/gpc-setting-enabled-1.png" alt="Global Privacy Control (GPC) Enabled by Default in DuckDuckGo Apps &amp; Extensions" loading="lazy"></p> <p>We&#x2019;re also thrilled to announce that several major publishers, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and Automattic (makers of WordPress), have committed to implementing GPC, and the New York Times has already done so.</p> <p>More broadly, we believe GPC can be a legally binding invocation of <a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/gpc/">your opt-out rights</a> under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and potentially other rights in other jurisdictions such as the EU under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). That means if you download the latest version of the DuckDuckGo app or extension and visit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a> from certain regions including California, Europe, Brazil, UAE, and Bermuda, you will have automatically invoked these opt-out rights, and they will take action accordingly (e.g., see the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/privacy">NYT Privacy FAQ</a>).</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whyenablegpcbydefault">Why enable GPC by default?</h2> <p>The initial impetus for GPC came from CCPA requiring businesses to respect browser settings that allow consumers to opt out of the &quot;sale&quot; of their personal data (with &quot;sale&quot; <a href="https://ccpa-info.com/faqs/definitions/">broadly defined</a> as value exchange). Under the CCPA <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/privacy/ccpa-fsor-appendix-e.pdf">Final Statement of Reasons - Appendix E #73</a>, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra explicitly stated that consumers can exercise their privacy rights by utilizing privacy-by-design products:</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;The consumer exercises their choice by affirmatively choosing the privacy control [&#x2026;] including when utilizing privacy-by-design products or services&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>DuckDuckGo is certainly a privacy-by-design product. By simply installing our app or extension, you are expressing your preference for privacy, without needing to fiddle with additional settings to further confirm this preference. We are private by default. So, it follows that GPC would be enabled by default along with all of our other privacy features like <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/">tracker blocking</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">private search</a>, and <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-smarter-encryption/">Smarter Encryption</a>.</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="eagertogiveitatry">Eager to give it a try?</h2> <h3 id="duckduckgoprivacybrowseronandroid">DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser on Android</h3> <p>Simply download and use the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android">DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser</a> from Google Play, or update to version 5.73.0 or newer.

Dear Google: We Agree Search Competition Should Be "Only 1 Click Away" – So Why Is It 15+ on Android?

Google claims search competition is “only one click away.” So why does it take fifteen+ clicks to make DuckDuckGo Search or any other alternative the default on Android devices?

Google search is made the default on Android devices in two ways, through the home screen search bar and default browser. Here is how someone can change both:</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol> <li>Open Google Play</li> <li>Search &#x201C;DuckDuckGo&#x201D; (technically at least three clicks)</li> <li>Tap <em>DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser</em></li> <li>Tap <em>Install</em></li> <li>Navigate to the DuckDuckGo icon</li> <li>Long-press the DuckDuckGo icon</li> <li>Tap the widgets icon</li> <li>Long-press the widget and place on home screen</li> <li>Long-press the Google widget</li> <li>Tap <em>Remove</em> (<a href="https://www.nextpit.com/how-to-remove-the-google-search-bar-from-your-android-homescreen">process may differ</a> and doesn&apos;t work on all devices, e.g., Google Pixel phones &#x2013; go figure!)</li> </ol> <p>Now you need to either make DuckDuckGo your default browser or make DuckDuckGo your default search engine in your preferred browser.

<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2020/10/gpc-header_green.png" alt="DuckDuckGo Founding Member in Global Privacy Control (GPC) Standards Effort"><p>We believe online privacy should be simple and accessible to everyone, period. With the introduction of privacy regulations worldwide, consumers are gaining more rights to limit the sale and sharing of their personal data. While this is a great idea in theory, it doesn&apos;t amount to much if it is hard for consumers to take advantage of their rights.</p> <p>At present, consumers must invoke most all online privacy rights manually, website by website. That&apos;s why we&apos;re proud to be a founding member of a <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/press-release/20201007.html">new effort</a> to create a simple browser-oriented setting for users to more easily express their preference for privacy, called <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org">Global Privacy Control (GPC)</a>. With this setting, users can enable it once, and then the browser will express their preference for privacy to every website they visit. We&apos;ve been working with <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#orgs">other organizations</a> to define a <a href="https://github.com/globalprivacycontrol/gpc-spec">technical specification</a> for GPC that we hope becomes a widely-adopted standard.</p> <p>Starting today, using the current technical specification, we are launching GPC in an initial experimental phase within our mobile DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser (for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/duckduckgo-privacy-browser/id663592361">iOS</a>/<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android">Android</a>) and within our desktop DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials browser extension (for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/duckduckgo-for-firefox/addon-385621-latest.xpi?src=external-app-top">Firefox</a>/<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg">Chrome</a>), making this new setting available to over ten million consumers.</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2>How does GPC work in practice?</h2> <p>Browser settings such as <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/do-not-track/">&quot;Do Not Track&quot;</a> have been available in the past, but most websites were not designed to recognize or respond to users&apos; preferences, and they were not legally required to do so. For many years DuckDuckGo has advocated for laws worldwide that would bring legal teeth to browser privacy settings like Do No Track, going so far as to even <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/do-not-track-act-2019/">draft our own legislation</a>. Thankfully, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a> is now leading the way here, requiring businesses to respect browser settings that allow consumers to opt out of the sale of their personal data. In his recent <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/47115516-3540-4AB8-8676-57882CF6B9E0">US Senate testimony</a>, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra explained:</p> <blockquote> <p>One provision of our regulations intended to facilitate the submission of a request to opt out of sale by requiring businesses to comply when a consumer has enabled a global privacy control at the device or browser level, which should be less time-consuming and burdensome. I urge the technology community to develop consumer-friendly controls to make exercise of the right to opt out of the sale of information meaningful and frictionless.</p> </blockquote> <p>We are excited to be part of the answer to AG Becerra&apos;s call to action by offering consumers GPC as a means to invoke their CCPA &#x201C;do not sell&#x201D; rights across multiple websites. Although currently CCPA rights are only available to California residents, certain companies such as Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/11/11/microsoft-california-privacy-rights/">have committed</a> to extend this right to all US residents. And at the same time, we also intend to work with data protection authorities in other countries to help ensure GPC is legally binding in more jurisdictions, such as in the EU where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> is in force.</p> <p>In this initial experimental phase for GPC, you can participate by downloading our mobile app and desktop browser extension, and then enable GPC in Settings (see instructions below). Once enabled, we will send the &#x201C;do not sell or share&#x201D; GPC signal on your behalf to every website you visit. Then, when you visit early-adopting sites like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a> (while using our app or extension), those sites will accept the signal and respect your preference for more privacy.</p> <p>We expect more commitments will follow from other organizations that will either send or respect the GPC signal. However, since Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a new standards effort, most websites won&apos;t recognize it yet. Currently websites are only required to act on the signal to the extent applicable laws compel them to do so.</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2>How to enable GPC using DuckDuckGo</h2> <h6>DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser on Android</h6> <ol> <li>Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android">DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser</a> from Google Play, or update to version 5.67.0 or newer.</li> <li>Within the app, go to &quot;Settings&quot; from the main menu.</li> <li>Tap &quot;Global Privacy Control&quot; and enable the setting.</li> </ol> <h6>DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser on iOS</h6> <ol> <li>Download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/duckduckgo-privacy-browser/id663592361">DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser</a> from the Apple App Store, or update to version 7.55.0 or newer.</li> <li>Within the app, go to &quot;Settings&quot; from the main menu.</li> <li>Tap &quot;Global Privacy Control&quot; and enable the setting.</li> </ol> <h6>DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials Desktop Browser Extension</h6> <ol> <li>Download DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/duckduckgo-for-firefox/addon-385621-latest.xpi?src=external-app-top">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg">Brave</a> or <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/caoacbimdbbljakfhgikoodekdnlcgpk">Microsoft Edge</a> (we&apos;re still working on updating our Safari extension), or update to version 2020.10.2 or newer.</li> <li>Once installed, click the extension&apos;s icon in your browser&apos;s toolbar.</li> <li>Click the cog icon at the top right and select &quot;Settings&quot;.</li> <li>In the &quot;Global Privacy Control&quot; section, enable the setting.</li> </ol> <p>Once installed, you can test whether the GPC setting is working by going to <a href="https://global-privacy-control.glitch.me/">https://global-privacy-control.glitch.me/</a> and checking the &quot;Client-side detection&quot; section.</p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><hr><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><em>For more privacy advice <a href="https://twitter.com/duckduckgo">follow us on Twitter</a>, and stay protected and informed with our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter">privacy newsletters</a>.</em></p> <!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
