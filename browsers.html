    <h1>Browsers </h1>
  <h2> Desktop Browsers </h2>
      <h3> Brave </h3>
  <p> Brave is a really good beginner browser. Some notable features are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint"> fingerprinting</a> 
    blocker, third-party cookie blocker, tracker blocker, the need of no extensions, and how it is similar to Google Chrome (In usability). A downside is it relies on the open source
    Chromium, by Google. <br> Even though of this, I reccommend Brave.

  <h3> Mozilla Firefox </h3> 
  <p> Mozilla Firefox is a really good browser for privacy and security. Some notable features are the social media blocker, third-party cookie blocker, 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint"> fingerprinting</a> blocker, its customizability, and the vast about:config. A downside 
  is the Mozilla Foundation is <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/mozilla-signs-lucrative-3-year-google-search-deal-for-firefox">
    making questionable business practices in order to make money,</a> but as a browser, Firefox is amazing. <br>
    <h2> a href="https://firefox.com">To Download Firefox</a> </h2>
      NOTE: According to <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/browsers/#firefox">Privacy Guides</a>, Firefox includes a unique download token in downloads
   from Mozilla's website and uses telemetry in Firefox to send the token. The token is not included in releases from the 
      <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/">Mozilla FTP</a>.</p>
