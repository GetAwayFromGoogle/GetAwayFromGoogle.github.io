    <h1>  Why Should I Care? </h1>
  <p> <i> I don't care about privacy because I have nothing to hide. </i><br> Listen to this excerpt of this 
    quote from Edward Snowden: <b> <i>”Arguing that you don't have privacy because you have nothing to hide is like arguing that 
      you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.”</b> </i> <br>Big compaines like Google and Meta (Facebook) collect your data. And they <b> sell </b>
  your data to data brokers for the highest bid. Don't believe me? Read 
    <a href="https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu/post/facebook-and-google-are-the-new-data-brokers"? this article</a> from the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
